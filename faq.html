			<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
			<h2>Is VonCoin Opensource?</h2>
			<p> Yes. Voncoin is absolutely opensource. Since Voncoin is utility driven through InRoid technologies, therefore even the hardware is opensource architecture.
			</p>
			<a name="howitworks"></a>
			<h2>How VonCoin system works?</h2>
			<p>
				VonCoin system is 3 step process.
				<ul>
					<li><b> Task generation :</b> Currency notes scanned from various devices(Cash handling machines) around the globe, capture value, space and time data and share with the Network(P2P). This creates MoneyChain.  </li>
					<li><b>Info generation :</b> Miners verify the money chain block and confirm value, space and time information. The extracted information is voted by all in network and winning miner(s) are allowed to create cryptocurrency based on trust protocol of VonCoin. The fiat trail is stored in Info Chain.</li>
					<li><b>Value storage :</b> The cryptocurrency protocol stores the transaction and new block awards on Value Chain. As such, value Chain is storage of VonCoin currency.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<h2>How to mine VonCoins?</h2>
			<p>
				VonCoins are generated by creating block of fiat currency bills/notes which are tracked through InRoid Class Cash Handling Machines. Cash Counting Machines are one of the prime classes apart from Vending machines and Bank ATMs, teller machines, etc.
			</p>
			<h2>How to buy a VonCoin compatible cash handling machine?</h2>
			<p>
				Currently general users can buy cash counting machines from the online store for a limited period. <a  href="http://inroid.voncoin.com">Here</a> is the link to purchase your VonCoin compatible CCM device. <a class="btn" href="http://inroid.voncoin.com">Buy Online</a>

			<h2>Is VonCoin secure?</h2>
			<p>VonCoin is architected on 3 Blockchain technology and trust protocols of the network. Therefore PoW/PoS type vulnerabilities are avoided.
			More generally, attacks like 51% are not possible on VonCoin network. All the task are generated from distributed and legitimate sources to meet the vision of fairness and transparency. And generated Info Chains and Value Chains cannot be run by any monopolistic approach.
			Thus, we can say that VonCoin is design-wise secure from vulnerabilities.

			<h2><a name="purpose"></a>Why is currency tracking important?</h2>
			<p>
				For ages since fiat circulation in 15th century, fiat circulation has created valuable commerce and trade system. The fiat system brought efficiency and ease of doing business. But along came the vices. From the ages, theft and ransom of various forms have created an alternate balck economy which pushes inflation, recession and affordability with every such act of deciet. 
				Currency tracking is an innovative solution, but doing this without P2P or such large network is very costly, time consuming and also trust-less if not done by all and together.
				Doing currency tracking on a P2P network model designed by Satoshi Nakamoto is  a perfect task which is in sink with visions of cryptocurrency, free world and true step towards empowerment process.
			</p>
			<h2> How many voncoins will be owned at time of launch on 1 May 2015?</h2>
			<p>
				On day of public launch of task generation and mining process on 1 May 2015, There will be zero coins overall. The coins will be awarded on mining rules of speed and accuracy on Info BlockChain generation from Money BlockChain. It is completely fair and transparent process.
			</p>

			<h2>Where can I find the sourcecode for mining software for VonCoin?</h2>
			<p>
				All the source code will be available at GitHub from 15 February 2015 for public critique.

			<h2>Where can I find the sourcecode for task generating software for InRoid devices?</h2>

			<h2>What is ROI on CCMs?<a name="roi"></a></h2>
			<p>
				For pre-order device, ROI will be approx 3 months.
				For Pre-booked device, ROI will be approx 1 years.
				Calculation as shown below:
				<br/>
				<u>Pre-Order ROI - <a href="http://inroid.voncoin.com/collections/frontpage/products/voncoin-task-generator-cash-counting-machine-standard-pre-order" class="btn">Buy here</a></u>
				<ul>
					<li>Number of coins mined per week = 100800 coins (explain: 100 coins/per block x 6 blocks per hour X 24 hours per day x 7 days per week) </li>
					<li>Market value of VonCoin - USD 1000 (explain: Based on peak price of bitcoin before loss of trust etc.) </li>
					<li>Coins allocated to task generators per week = 50% of 100800 = 50400 coins</li>
					<li>Total value earned by task generators(CCMs) = USD 50.4 million </li>
					<li> Total value earned by individual task generator(CCMs) = USD 504 </li>
					<li> Time required to earn USD 5000 = 9.92 weeks ~ 2.5 months</li>
				</ul>

				<br/>
				<u>Pre-Book ROI - <a href="http://inroid.voncoin.com/collections/frontpage/products/voncoin-task-generator-cash-counting-machine-standard-pre-book" class="btn">Book here</a></u>
			<ul>
				<li>Based on above steps, Pre-booked machines would earn USD 10000 worth of VonCoins in 5 months(But will not earn due to end of 3 month limited operation of VonCoin on CCMs).</li>
				<li>Limited release of Task-generators end on 31 July 2015, and value earn rate will get distributed further among task generators</li>
				<li>Time required to earn USD 4000 = 9 Months (explain: USD 4000/110 USD per week)</li>
				<li>Total ROI period: 1 Year</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<h2>Who can mine VonCoins?</h2>
			<p>Anyone can mine VonCoins. Only the task generation function will be in limited release for 3 months from 1 May to 31 July of 2015. You just need a standard computer to do mining.</p>

			<h2>Why is KYC required for task generating machines?</h2>
			<p>VonCoin is utility based to track money laundering and misuses of fiat currency. To keep the purpose legitimate and truly traceable, all task-generators will have to undergo KYC process and help law-enforcement agencies. We would always cooperate with all local laws for any such requirements.</p>
